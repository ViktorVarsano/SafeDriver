## General Info:
:sparkles:    This App helps you get real-time estimation about what is your brake distance in meters if you drive in the city. I was inspired to create this app to remind others that badly-calculated distance can actually be dangerous if you need to suddenly need to stop. Hence, allowing for a bigger distance from the vehicle in front of you can safe you from unwanted situations. I hope this app will help make people become safer drivers by keeping appropriate distance :sparkles:
